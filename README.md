# ACM - Acme Customer Management
Project from Pluralsight's course: Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals in C# - with Deborah Kurata. Also added Practical LINQ and Defensive coding in C# also with Deborah Kurata. <br /> 
After completing the tutorial I'll expand it a little bit, adding stuff like SQL etc

Status : 
* Module 10/10 -OOP Fundamentals in C#
* Module 6/6 - Practical LINQ
* Module 8/8 - Defensive coding in C#

Still a long way to go to make it useful
